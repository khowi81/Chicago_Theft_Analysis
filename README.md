# Chicago_Theft_Analysis
Data Analysis Project featuring Chicago Crimes Dataset found here https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/about_data
This report analyzes crime data from 2013 to 2023
The focus of this analysis is "how likely are thefts and motor vehicle thefts in Chicago, based on location and ward?" 
This project includes visualizations, such as bar charts and heatmaps
There's a powerpoint that explains my findings.
