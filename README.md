Exploring Urban Trends: Clustering Analysis and Crime Trends in Chicago
As part of my final project for an applied research and data science course, I conducted a two-part analysis to showcase my data analytics and statistical skills.

Part I: Clustering Analysis of TIF Districts
Leveraged the K-means clustering algorithm to analyze Chicago's Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts. By grouping districts based on property tax extraction and expenses, the analysis revealed financial disparities that highlight development patterns and inform urban planning decisions. Key outcomes included identifying distinct clusters and interpreting economic activity across districts.

Part II: Crime Trends Analysis in Chicago
Conducted hypothesis testing and probability calculations to analyze theft and motor vehicle theft trends in Chicago from 2013 to 2023. The study examined crime distribution by wards and locations such as streets, alleys, and retail areas, emphasizing the importance of filtering and cleaning data in large, real-world datasets. Key insights included a nuanced understanding of crime patterns and their geographic distribution, challenging misconceptions about safety in Chicago.

This project combined statistical rigor, data wrangling, and visualization to derive actionable insights, demonstrating my ability to handle complex datasets and present findings clearly.
